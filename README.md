# cleaning-a-messy-dataframe

This is a project created for a Codecademy meet-up. The event description reads as follows: 

A huge part of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. Some have estimated that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analysing it or building models from it. [Source]


ðŸ“” In this meet-up, we will clean and tidy a messy Kaggle dataset using Python - preview the dataset here. You may choose to download it prior to the meet-up and follow along on your own machine, though just watching is ok, too. 

ðŸ“” Whilst I was originally intending to centre the meetup around a book/literary theme, I found the aforementioned dataframe (csv) just right for a short meet-up. Though it is titled Amazon book reviews - which is how I found it - it seems to be more about personal care product reviews. 

ðŸ“” Following a presentation and before/after demo, we will go straight into the code along. 

ðŸ“” You may find this meet-up useful if you are a beginner, just like me, and interested in playing around with real-world data, data analysis or data science in a broader sense. 



See you there ðŸ‘‹
